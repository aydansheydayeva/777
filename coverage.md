## Line and Branch Coverage

Branch coverage which analyzes each logical path of the whole code shows better results compared to line coverage. Due to the fact that code written by developers can change, branch coverage would be the best choice for developers. Whereas line coverage measures the liines of code without including conditionals, comments etc.
